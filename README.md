# Get Started

1. `$ yarn install` from root directory
2. `$ cd packages/common`, `$ yarn decl` to build the declaration file
3. open a new terminal window and `$ cd packages/web`, then `$ yarn start`
4. back in the terminal window with `common`, run `$ yarn build:watch:decl`
5. now on successful compilation of `common`, the declaration file will be updated atuomatically, and this will cause `web` to update automatically too
